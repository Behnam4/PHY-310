  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Halley’s comet, observed by Chinese astronomers over $2000$ years ago,
    has an eccentricity of $0.967$ and a period of $76$ years. What shape is its
    orbit? What are its minimum and maximum distances from the sun?
    (Mass of the sun$=2 \times 10^{30} ~ kg$.)
    
    \item A particle of mass $m$ in one dimension is subject to a force
    $$F=\dfrac{a}{x^2} e^{-bt}$$
    where a and b are positive, dimensionful constants. Write down the Lagrangian, 
    the Hamiltonian, the Euler-Lagrange equations, and Hamilton’s equations. Is energy 
    conserved during the motion? Why, or why not?

    \item Suppose that the sun’s mass suddenly decreases by half (of course that
    can’t really happen, since mass-energy is conserved). Assume the earth
    is initially on a circular orbit. What orbit will the earth now have? Will
    it escape the solar system?

    \item A particle of mass m, subject to gravity, is constrained to move along
    the spiral $z=b\theta, ~ r=r_0$, where $b$ and $r_0$ are positive constants, and $z$
    is the vertical direction. Find Hamilton’s equations. 

    \item Using Cartesian coordinates, show that when $\epsilon > 1$, the equation
    $r(\phi)=\dfrac{c}{1+ \epsilon ~ cos(\phi)}$ can be rewritten as the equation for a shifted hyperbola
    $$\dfrac{(x-\delta)^2}{\alpha^2}-\dfrac{y^2}{\beta^2}=1$$
    Find $\alpha, \beta,$ and $\delta$ in terms of $c$ and $\epsilon$.


    \item Verify that $r=a cos(\phi)$ is a solution for the central force 
    $\overrightarrow{F}=-\dfrac{k}{r^5} \hat{r}$. Find $a$ in terms of $k, ~ \mu$ 
    (the reduced mass), and $\ell$ (the angular momentum).


    \item \begin{enumerate}
      \item Using the effective potential, show that for a force $\overrightarrow{F}=-\dfrac{a}{r} \hat{r}$,
      there are only bounded orbits, and find the radius of the circular orbit.

      \item Use Kepler’s third law to calculate the altitude above the earth’s
      surface of geostationary satellites, which are east-moving satellites
      over the equator that take exactly one day to go around the earth
      and therefore are always above the same spot. (The mass of the
      earth is $6 \times 10^{24} ~ kg$ and the radius is $6400 ~ km$.)
